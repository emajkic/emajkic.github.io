        UBC Rocket is a student engineering design team dedicated to the design, manufacture, and launch of suborbital rockets. As a member of the avionics group working on the team's yearly international competitions rocket, I develop the electronics and firmware that allow the rocket to fly.

        While working on the navigation side of the software for our robot, I developed
        ROS (Robot Operating System) Python scripts to allow the robot to navigate new,
        dynamic environments. This meant integrating various sensors with software and
        developing communication protocols for the robot's subsystems. All ROS
        development was done on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04). I also performed research and
        analysis of LIDAR sensors and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
        frameworks for use in the robot.

        Further, during my first few months after joining Open Robotics, I performed
        mechanical onboarding for the team. This included designing a chassis for a
        simple robot using OnShape CAD and 3D printing various mechanical components.
        During this time, I gained hands-on experience with mechanical design and
        robotics practices used in industry.
