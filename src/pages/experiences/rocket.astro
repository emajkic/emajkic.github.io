        UBC Rocket is a student engineering design team dedicated to the design, manufacture, and launch of suborbital rockets. As a member of the avionics group working on the team's yearly international competitions rocket, I develop the electronics and firmware that allow the rocket to fly.

        My current project on the team is developing a pyrotechnic PCB board and its firmware. This board ignites the e-matches inside the rocket at apogee and halfway through its descent in order to deploy the recovery parachutes. I wrote embedded firmware in C for a custom ignition PCB using an STM32 (ARM Cortex-M0+) MCU, allowing for communication with flight controller and precise logic for critical in-flight parachute deployment.
        I validated the hardware and firmware of the board by testing with oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers, simulating SPI communication from a programmable master.
