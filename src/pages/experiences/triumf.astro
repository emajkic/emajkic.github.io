      <p>
        During my time at TRIUMF, I worked with the PIONEER group on a rare pion decay
        experiment. The PIONEER experiment will be conducted in a large liquid xenon
        (LXe) calorimeter, and continuous monitoring of the LXe's purity is required
        during the experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve this, I was involved in the testing and development of a Purity
        Monitor Assembly (PUMA) and its calibration device to be used in high-precision
        experiments with LXe calorimeters.
      </p>

    <div class="mt-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
      <p>
        I conducted physics simulations of PUMA to better understand particle behaviour
        inside the assembly in various media. I used COMSOL Multiphysics to perform
        electrostatic finite element analysis on the CAD model of PUMA.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also wrote C++ scripts in Linux using Garfield++, a library written by CERN
        for detailed simulation of particle drift in detectors. Some results are shown
        below.

    <div class="mt-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
      <p>
        Further, I designed and built a vacuum system to perform initial tests of the
        calibration device for PUMA.

        After ensuring the vacuum system could reliably reach low pressures over
        extended periods of time, I began testing PUMA's calibration device inside the
        vacuum system.

        Working at TRIUMF was a great experience and I enjoyed being in charge of a
        project within a larger cutting-edge physics context.

        At the end of my term, I participated in TRIUMF's co-op poster session and was
        awarded 2nd place.
