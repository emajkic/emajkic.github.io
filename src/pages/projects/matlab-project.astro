      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Over the summer after second year, one of the courses I took was partial differential equations (MATH 257). Often, we would solve PDEs with exotic boundary conditions and source terms, which produced strange-looking solutions that were difficult to visualize. I kept finding myself wanting a way to visualize the solution to a PDE, even in cases where I could not simply type my answer into Desmos (for example, solutions involving infinite sums).

    <div class="mt-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
       I decided to develop a MATLAB script that employed numerical methods—specifically the finite difference method—to solve and display solutions of the wave equation under user-defined boundary conditions, initial conditions, and source terms. I shared my final script with other students, allowing everyone to use it as a learning tool.
