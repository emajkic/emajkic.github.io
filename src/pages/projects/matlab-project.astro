        Over the summer after second year, one of the courses I took was partial differential equations (MATH 257). I really enjoyed the course and wanted to immerse myself in the content as much as I could. Often, we would solve PDEs with exotic boundary conditions and source terms, which produced strange-looking solutions that were difficult to visualize. I kept finding myself wanting a way to visualize the solution to a PDE, even in cases where I could not simply type my answer into Desmos (for example, solutions involving infinite sums).

        I recalled that earlier in the course we had learned about numerical methods for computing approximate solutions to PDEs. I endeavoured to develop a MATLAB script that employed these numerical methods—specifically the finite difference method—to solve and display solutions of the wave equation under user-defined boundary conditions, initial conditions, and source terms. I shared my final script with other students, allowing everyone to use it as a learning tool.
